# Healthy-vs-Diseased-leaves-detection
In this repo, I will host a computer vision project to detect diseased leaves among healthy ones.

With the 2D CNN model I created, I achieved an **accuracy of 97%**, taking the first place in [this Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/d-4-computer-vision).
For the data reach out to the competiton link above.
